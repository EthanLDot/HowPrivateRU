# HowPrivateRU
This project was built from scratch, except for airtable.browser.js. No templates were used.

Purpose: The user enters a survey asking them what smart products they own or intend to own soon. Using Airtable and Mozilla's "privacy not included" buyer's guide, the website processes the user's answers and informs them of any privacy issues that may arise with their selections.
